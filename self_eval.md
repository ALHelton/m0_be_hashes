# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I really struggled with putting if statements to my hashes. I had to connect the dots with a lot of information, and it was quite a productive process.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note taking is going better - I reached out to Kaitlyn and got some pointers regarding what I could be doing to take effecient notes. I have begun to prep myself the night before and take notes in advance.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I lean into trying to solve a code first. It seems to be more immediate, and is satisfying if I get it right without googling.
